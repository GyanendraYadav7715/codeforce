Tightly_Encapsulated_Class:

  Why_To_Learn:
    - Ensures maximum data protection
    - Prevents accidental field exposure
    - Improves API safety
    - Required in enterprise-grade systems
    - Frequently asked in interviews

  Clear_Definition:
    Meaning: "A class in which ALL variables are declared private."
    Important_Rule: 
      - Every field must be private
      - Access allowed only through methods
    Condition:
      - If even one variable is not private → NOT tightly encapsulated

  Core_Concept:

    Incorrect_Example:
      Code: |
        class Student {
            private int marks;
            public String name;   // breaks tight encapsulation
        }
      Problem:
        - name is publicly accessible
        - Class is NOT tightly encapsulated

    Correct_Example:
      Code: |
        class Student {

            private int marks;
            private String name;

            public int getMarks() {
                return marks;
            }

            public void setMarks(int marks) {
                if(marks >= 0) {
                    this.marks = marks;
                }
            }

            public String getName() {
                return name;
            }

            public void setName(String name) {
                this.name = name;
            }
        }

      Result:
        - All variables private
        - Access controlled
        - This is tightly encapsulated

  Important_Clarification:
    - Methods can be public
    - Variables must be private
    - Class itself can be public
    - Only field visibility matters

  JVM_Internal_Process:

    Step_1_Class_Loading:
      - Field access flags stored in Method Area
      - Each field marked as private in metadata

    Step_2_Compile_Time_Check:
      - Compiler prevents direct field access
      - Illegal access causes compilation error

    Step_3_Runtime_Verification:
      - JVM bytecode verifier checks access rules
      - Ensures private access not violated

    Security_Level:
      Compile_Time: enforced
      Runtime: verified

  Real_Life_Example:

    Bank_Locker_System:
      Fields:
        - Locker_balance (private)
        - Locker_pin (private)
      Access:
        - Only through authorized methods
      Concept:
        - Direct vault access impossible
        - All interaction controlled

  Spring_Boot_Usage:

    DTO_Example:
      Code: |
        public class UserDTO {

            private String username;
            private String email;

            public String getUsername() {
                return username;
            }

            public void setUsername(String username) {
                this.username = username;
            }

            public String getEmail() {
                return email;
            }

            public void setEmail(String email) {
                this.email = email;
            }
        }

      Purpose:
        - Protects data structure
        - Prevents direct manipulation
        - Framework uses getters/setters via reflection

    Entity_Example:
      Code: |
        @Entity
        public class Product {

            private Long id;
            private double price;

            public double getPrice() {
                return price;
            }

            public void setPrice(double price) {
                if(price > 0) {
                    this.price = price;
                }
            }
        }

      Reason:
        - Ensures business rule enforcement
        - Prevents invalid state

  Difference_From_Encapsulation:

    Encapsulation:
      - Data + behavior bundled together

    Tightly_Encapsulated_Class:
      - Specific rule about field visibility
      - All fields must be private

  System_Level_Benefits:
    Data_Protection: maximum
    API_Safety: high
    Bug_Risk: reduced
    Maintenance: easier
    Security: stronger

  Interview_Point:
    Question: "When is a class tightly encapsulated?"
    Answer: "When all its data members are private."

  One_Line_Summary:
    "A tightly encapsulated class is one in which every field is declared private, ensuring complete data protection."
