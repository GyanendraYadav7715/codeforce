Has_A_Relationship_Composition:

  Why_To_Learn:
    - Promotes loose coupling
    - Encourages modular design
    - Preferred over inheritance in many real systems
    - Core principle in Spring Boot architecture
    - Improves flexibility and maintainability

  Clear_Definition:
    Meaning: "Has-A relationship occurs when one class contains a reference of another class."
    Concept: "One object uses another object as part of its state."
    Keywords:
      - Object reference
      - Composition
      - Aggregation (variant)

  Basic_Syntax:
    Code: |
      class Engine {
          void start() {
              System.out.println("Engine started");
          }
      }

      class Car {

          private Engine engine;  // Has-A relationship

          Car() {
              engine = new Engine();
          }

          void drive() {
              engine.start();
              System.out.println("Car is moving");
          }
      }

  Core_Concept:

    Parent_Object:
      - Contains reference of another object

    Contained_Object:
      - Performs specific task
      - Used by parent object

    Relationship_Type:
      - Car HAS-A Engine

  JVM_Internal_Process:

    Code: |
      Car car = new Car();

    Step_1_Class_Loading:
      - Engine class loaded into Method Area
      - Car class loaded into Method Area

    Step_2_Object_Creation:
      Heap:
        - Car object created
        - Engine object created

    Step_3_Reference_Storage:
      Stack:
        - car variable holds reference to Car object
      Heap:
        Car_Object:
          engine -> reference to Engine object

    Final_Memory_Model:
      - Two separate objects in Heap
      - One object stores reference to another

  Memory_Visualization:
    Stack:
      car -> (Car object address)

    Heap:
      Car_Object:
        engine -> (Engine object address)
      Engine_Object:
        no internal references

  Real_Life_Example:

    Computer_System:
      Computer HAS-A:
        - CPU
        - RAM
        - HardDisk

    University_System:
      University HAS-A:
        - Departments
        - Students

  Spring_Boot_Usage:

    Service_And_Repository:
      Code: |
        @Service
        public class UserService {

            @Autowired
            private UserRepository userRepository;

            public User save(User user) {
                return userRepository.save(user);
            }
        }

      Explanation:
        - UserService HAS-A UserRepository
        - Service uses repository
        - Loose coupling via dependency injection

    Order_Service_Example:
      Code: |
        @Service
        public class OrderService {

            private PaymentService paymentService;

            public OrderService(PaymentService paymentService) {
                this.paymentService = paymentService;
            }

            public void placeOrder() {
                paymentService.pay(1000);
            }
        }

      Concept:
        - OrderService HAS-A PaymentService
        - Implementation can change without modifying OrderService

  Composition_vs_Inheritance:

    Inheritance_Is_A:
      - Strong coupling
      - Child depends on parent structure
      - Uses extends

    Composition_Has_A:
      - Loose coupling
      - Object collaboration
      - Uses object references
      - Preferred in modern architecture

  Advantages:
    - Flexible design
    - Replaceable components
    - Better modularity
    - Easier testing
    - Supports dependency injection

  Disadvantages:
    - Slightly more boilerplate code
    - Requires proper dependency management

  Engineering_Principle:
    Recommended_Rule:
      "Favor Composition over Inheritance"

  Interview_Point:
    Question: "What is Has-A relationship?"
    Answer: "It is a composition relationship where one class contains a reference to another class."

  One_Line_Summary:
    "Has-A relationship represents composition where one object contains and uses another object to achieve functionality."
