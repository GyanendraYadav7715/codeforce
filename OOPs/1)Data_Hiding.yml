1)Data Hiding:
      concept: Data hiding is the practise of restricting direct access to class variables by making them private and providing controlled access through methods.

      feature:
            It protects system integrity.
            It prevents accidental corruption of data.
            It enforces business rules.
            It makes large systems stable.
            It improves security.

      apply: We use private to hide variables then we expose controlled access via getter
           setter,and custom methods.

      summary: Data Hiding protects internal object state by restricting direct access and allowing controlled modification.
       
        
Java_Object_Creation_Flow:

  Step_1_Class_Loading:
    Trigger: "When JVM encounters Person class for first time"
    Process:
      - ClassLoader loads Person.class file
      - Bytecode is read
      - Class metadata stored in Method Area
    Method_Area_Contains:
      - Class name: Person
      - Field definitions:
          - name: age
            type: int
            access_modifier: private
      - Method definitions
      - Runtime constant pool
      - Access flags
    Object_Created: false
    Purpose: "Stores blueprint, not actual object"

  Step_2_Object_Creation:
    Trigger: "new Person()"
    Process:
      - JVM checks if class already loaded
      - Memory allocated in Heap
      - Default values assigned
    Heap_Object:
      Object_Type: Person
      Fields:
        age: 0
    Object_Created: true
    Purpose: "Creates real instance in memory"

  Step_3_Reference_Assignment:
    Code: "Person p = new Person();"
    Stack:
      Variable_Name: p
      Type: reference
      Points_To: "Heap memory address of Person object"
    Purpose: "Stack holds reference, not object"

  Step_4_Field_Storage:
    Location: Heap
    Behavior:
      - Each object has separate copy of fields
      - Memory allocated per object
    Example:
      p1:
        age: 0
      p2:
        age: 0

  Step_5_Access_Control_Enforcement:
    Access_Modifier: private
    Compile_Time_Check:
      - Compiler verifies accessibility
      - Direct access outside class: error
    Runtime_Check:
      - JVM bytecode verifier checks access flags
    Protection_Level:
      - Compile time safety
      - Runtime bytecode verification

Memory_Model_Summary:
  Method_Area: "Class blueprint and metadata"
  Heap: "Actual objects and field values"
  Stack: "Method calls and references"
  Access_Modifiers: "Security guard controlling field access"
