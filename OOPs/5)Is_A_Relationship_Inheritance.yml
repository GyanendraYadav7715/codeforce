Is_A_Relationship_Inheritance:

  Why_To_Learn:
    - Enables code reuse
    - Supports runtime polymorphism
    - Reduces duplication
    - Allows hierarchical design
    - Core concept in framework development
    - Frequently asked in interviews

  Clear_Definition:
    Meaning: "Is-A relationship occurs when one class extends another class."
    Keyword_Used: extends
    Concept: "Child class inherits properties and behaviors of parent class."

  Basic_Syntax:
    Code: |
      class Animal {
          void eat() {
              System.out.println("Eating...");
          }
      }

      class Dog extends Animal {
          void bark() {
              System.out.println("Barking...");
          }
      }

  Core_Concept:

    Parent_Class:
      - Provides common properties
      - Provides common behavior

    Child_Class:
      - Inherits parent members
      - Can add new behavior
      - Can override methods

  Object_Creation_Flow:

    Code: |
      Dog d = new Dog();

    JVM_Process:
      Step_1:
        - Animal class loaded into Method Area
      Step_2:
        - Dog class loaded into Method Area
      Step_3:
        - Memory allocated in Heap for Dog object
      Step_4:
        - Parent constructor executes first
      Step_5:
        - Child constructor executes
      Final_Object:
        - Single object containing:
            - Parent fields
            - Child fields

  Memory_Visualization:
    Heap_Object:
      Type: Dog
      Contains:
        - Animal properties
        - Dog properties

  Method_Overriding_Example:

    Code: |
      class Animal {
          void sound() {
              System.out.println("Animal sound");
          }
      }

      class Dog extends Animal {
          @Override
          void sound() {
              System.out.println("Bark");
          }
      }

      public class Main {
          public static void main(String[] args) {
              Animal a = new Dog();
              a.sound();
          }
      }

    Output: "Bark"

    Explanation:
      - Reference type: Animal
      - Object type: Dog
      - JVM uses Dynamic Method Dispatch
      - Method resolved at runtime

  Runtime_Polymorphism:
    Enabled_By: Inheritance
    Resolution_Time: Runtime
    Mechanism: Dynamic Method Dispatch

  Real_Life_Example:

    Person_Hierarchy:
      Parent: Person
      Children:
        - Student
        - Teacher
      Concept:
        - Student is a Person
        - Teacher is a Person

  Spring_Boot_Usage:

    Base_Entity_Example:
      Code: |
        @MappedSuperclass
        public class BaseEntity {

            private LocalDateTime createdAt;
            private LocalDateTime updatedAt;

        }

        @Entity
        public class User extends BaseEntity {

            private String username;
        }

      Benefit:
        - Common audit fields reused
        - Avoids duplication

    Exception_Hierarchy:
      Example:
        - RuntimeException
        - CustomBusinessException extends RuntimeException
      Purpose:
        - Structured error handling

  Advantages:
    - Code reusability
    - Extensibility
    - Cleaner hierarchy
    - Supports polymorphism

  Disadvantages:
    - Tight coupling
    - Can lead to fragile base class problem
    - Overuse makes system rigid

  Important_Rules:
    - Java supports single inheritance (one parent class)
    - Multiple inheritance allowed via interfaces
    - Parent constructor runs before child constructor
    - Private members are NOT inherited (but accessible via methods)

  Difference_From_Has_A:
    Is_A:
      - Uses extends
      - Represents inheritance
      - Strong coupling
    Has_A:
      - Uses object reference
      - Represents composition
      - Looser coupling

  Interview_Point:
    Question: "What is Is-A relationship?"
    Answer: "It is inheritance where one class extends another class to reuse properties and behaviors."

  One_Line_Summary:
    "Is-A relationship allows a child class to inherit properties and behaviors of a parent class using inheritance."
